# Todos

* formulas as structs, free var and stuff as generics? that way you can have binding forms for your theory, and operator overloading
* `ForallL*`
* delayed formulae so they can access parameters
* context queries to avoid having to hard-code ctx formulae
* implicit Sequence on proof macros
* for stuff like AddSucc, AddCommute, etc., they pollute the context. Find a way to do the replacement while leaving the context unchanged from the input
